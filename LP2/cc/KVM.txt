Practical 2 : (KVM)

(Steps)

~Step 1 : Check Virtualization Support 

-> egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
If the command returns a value of 0, your processor is not capable of running KVM.

-> sudo kvm-ok
If kvm-ok returns an error stating KVM acceleration cannot be used, try solving the problem by installing cpu-checker.

To install cpu-checker, run the following command
-> sudo apt install cpu-checker
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~Step 2 : Install KVM on Ubuntu 
First, update the repositories:
-> sudo apt update

Then, install essential KVM packages with the following command:
-> sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils

When prompted, type Y, press ENTER, and wait for the installation to finish.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~Step 3 : Authorize Users
Only members of the libvirt and kvm user groups can run virtual machines. Add a user to the libvirt group by typing:
-> sudo adduser 'username' libvirt
Replace username with the actual username.

Now do the same for the kvm group:
-> sudo adduser 'username' kvm

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~Step 4 : Verify the Installation
Confirm the installation was successful by using the virsh command:
-> virsh list --all

Or use the systemctl command to check the status of libvirtd:
-> sudo systemctl status libvirtd
If everything is functioning properly, the output returns an active (running) status.
Press Q to quit the status screen.

If the virtualization daemon is not active, activate it with the following command:
-> sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~Step 5 :
Start virt-manager with:
-> sudo virt-manager

(Theory)

KVM :
Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is an open source virtualization technology built into Linux®. Specifically, KVM lets you turn Linux into a hypervisor that allows a host machine to run multiple, isolated virtual environments called guests or virtual machines (VMs).

Hypervisor :
A hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor, sometimes called a virtual machine monitor (VMM)

virtual environment :
A virtual environment is a networked application that allows a user to interact with both the computing environment and the work of other users

SSH :
SSH stands for Secure Shell. It is a network protocol that provides a secure and encrypted method for accessing and managing remote computers. SSH allows users to log in to a remote system over an unsecured network (such as the internet) and perform various tasks securely.

Chmod :
-chmod is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems that is used to change the permissions of files and directories. It stands for "change mode," indicating its purpose of modifying the access mode or permissions of a file or directory.
-The chmod command allows users to specify who can read, write, and execute a file or directory. It is often used to control access to files and determine the level of permissions for different users or groups.
